# 🎬 3D Flip Movie Card
### Interactive HTML & CSS UI Project

This project is an interactive movie card built with pure HTML and CSS.  
When the user hovers over the card, it performs a smooth 3D flip animation, revealing the back side that contains movie details such as description, genre, and additional info.  
The project is designed to practice UI design, CSS animations, and 3D transform effects.
